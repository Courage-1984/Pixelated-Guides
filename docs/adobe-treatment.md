::: info ‎ 
Monkrus is a cool Russian dude and you can find his treatments [here](https://w14.monkrus.ws/).
:::

1. Open https://w14.monkrus.ws/ in your browser, scroll down until you see a search bar, search for the name of the software you're interested in and click enter.
2. Ctrl+f the page and search for `Сортировать по дате`, click on this so that it is sorted by date, so that you get the latest version of the software.
3. Once on the software page, scroll down to the list of links of torrents, `UNIONDHT.ORG` is recommended.
4. Now download the torrent, it's best to always go with magnet links when downloading torrents, so look for the `🧲` icon and click on that so that it is automatically added to your torrent client.
5. When the torrent finished downloading, run or extract the `.iso` file and then run `autoplay.exe`, and that's it!

::: tip
  Read through the comments on the page of the software you are downloading, a lot of the time people provide solutions you didn't know you were going to need.

**With the intention of keeping all guides equal, we're stopping "guides from discord" due to character limitation, and simply having the links to redirect to the appropriate guides on r/GenP Reddit.**

*Easier for us to update overall, and easier for everyone to find the same guides with the same information*

### tips and guides

**"Loading Creative Cloud" loop**

If your Creative Cloud app isn't showing any updates or stuck in a "Loading Creative Cloud" loop (especially after reinstalling it), That might be caused by CCStopper that you might have used to disable the checkout pop up banner when you try to install any CC app. The fix for that is pretty simple, you just need to go to the firewall "Outbound Rules" option and remove or disable the CCStopper Rule.

Use the following two commands in PowerShell (admin) if your apps are warning you of unlicensed or non-genuine usage.

```powershell
  Add-Content -Path $env:windir\System32\drivers\etc\hosts -Value "`n0.0.0.0`t7g2gzgk9g1.adobe.io" -Force
```

```powershell
  Add-Content -Path $env:windir\System32\drivers\etc\hosts -Value "`n0.0.0.0`tic.adobe.io" -Force
```

If you prefer to do this manually, you can add the following two lines to the system hosts file (located in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc) using a text editor of your choice—

> 0.0.0.0 7g2gzgk9g1.adobe.io
>
> 0.0.0.0 ic.adobe.io

**How to Uninstall AGS - Adobe Genuine Service**

Open PowerShell, as admin, and enter:

```powershell
[System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start("C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\AdobeGCClient\AdobeCleanUpUtility.exe")
```
and follow the on-screen instructions.

If that directory is absent then the service won’t be installed.
