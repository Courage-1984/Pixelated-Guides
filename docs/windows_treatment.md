**This guide will teach you how to completely treat Windows.**

1. Right-click on the Windows start menu and select PowerShell or Terminal (Not CMD). You could also press "Windows Button+R", type "powershell" and press enter.
2. Inside your PowerShell/Terminal run the following command:

```powershell
irm https://massgrave.dev/get | iex
```
OR
```powershell
irm https://get.activated.win | iex
```

3. Wait a few seconds for the command to run and a new window should pop up (click yes if it prompts you if you would like the app to run).
4. Press `1` for permanent Windows activation, the activation will begin. You should wait a few seconds and the activation will end!
5. Your Windows should now be succesfully activated and the watemark should be gone if you had one.
